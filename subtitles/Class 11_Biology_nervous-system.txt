[0.0 sec] dear students welcome back today let me ask something from you have you ever worked on a computer I'm sure your answer will be yes whatever you type on a keyboard it appears on the monitor screen
[30.0 sec] put command you give to a mouse can we seen being performed on the monitor there's a CPU Center processing unit that controls the functioning of all parts of the computer
[60.0 sec] I've seen many cars on the road you all are aware about the different parts of a car like engine body Wheels Etc all these parts of a car work under the control of a driver I hope you have got an idea on which August system we are going to discuss yes it is a nervous system
[90.0 sec] students in our body this control function is performed by the brain which is a part of the nervous system nervous system can be thought of as a body's Communication System it constantly
[120.0 sec] disease records and transmits information all the systems of our body are under the control of the nervous system without the nervous system we cannot see feel think here tastes or do anything else the numbers
[150.0 sec] what time is made up of millions of nerve cells known as neurons neurons are the smallest structural and functional units of the nervous system here you can see the structure of a nerve cells which is also called neuron it consists of the cell body finger like extensions called
[180.0 sec] Androids and a long tube like spot called the Exxon students you know that a neurons are the oldest and longest cells in the human body the novel system is driving
[210.0 sec] central nervous system consisting of brain and spinal cord peripheral nervous system consisting of nerves now we will discuss on each and every part of the nervous system brain man has the most
[240.0 sec] that is why human beings are regarded as the highest evolved group of animals it is a control center of our body it is similar to a supercomputer it can store a lot of information and the recall that information when required you know what is this called This is called memory
[270.0 sec] our brain is present inside a cavity of the skull that you all know it is called Cranium to protect the brain from sharks and jokes the space between the brain and the skull is filled with the flute called cerebral spinal fluid that acts like a cushion in vehicles like
[300.0 sec] car bike Etc shock absorbers work with the similar way to protect us from Road sharks like speed breaker deep pits uneven roads are the shock absorbers contain spring and oil you know the human
[330.0 sec] has three main parts they are cerebrum cerebellum and medulla sorry bro it is the largest part of the brain it is made up of two parts
[360.0 sec] what does Metapod deep ridges and grooves as students you can see it resembles like a walnut yes the functions of cerebrum it controls the working of our body
[390.0 sec] responsible for thinking logic memory learning and intelligence cerebellum the cerebellum is also called the little brain it is situated below the cerebrum it is smaller than the cerebrum functions of cerebellum and
[420.0 sec] poster of our body while walking running cycling etcetera with controls and coordinates the movement of voluntary muscles medulla it is also known as the brain stem it is bird shaped it forms a connection between the brain and the spinal cord it is the simplest part of human
[450.0 sec] it remains active even when we are asleep functions of medical it controls involuntary actions such as breathing sneezing and heartbeats let's have some activity you will be given 15
[480.0 sec] change to view these pictures are right on a piece of paper how many items you can remember the same we will discuss during our life interaction students I want to share with you some facts on human brain on average
[510.0 sec] play brain waves between 1.0 kg to 1.5 kg the right half of the brain controls the left side of the body similarly the left half of the brain controls the right side of the body does when one side of the brain is damaged the opposite side of the body gets affected
[540.0 sec] your brain is the fattest organ in your body it needs a continuous supply of oxygen and blood for survival a person's face if his heart is not able to send enough blood to his brain we must get enough sleep to rest or praying students
[570.0 sec] human brain has the capacity to generate approximately 23 watts of power when awake which can be used to power a small light bulb spinal cord it is a thick bundle of nerves connecting the brain to the rest of our body it is protected by the backbone
[600.0 sec] functions of spinal cord it helps in the transfer of information between the brain and other parts of the body it also controls actions that do not involve the
[630.0 sec] set actions are called reflex actions now let me give you an example on reflex action if we touch something sharp we automatically or hand without thinking about it such automatic immediate response is controlled by the spinal cord
[660.0 sec] it is known as The Reflex action news on Netflix structures made up of nerve cells they're like telephone wires which link every part of the body with the brain and carry messages between brain and other
[690.0 sec] cast of the body they carry messages in the form of impulses throughout the body the pathway of an Impulse is the nerve they arise either from the brain or from spinal cord the nerves that arise from the brain are called cranial nerves and the nose that rise from spinal cord are called spinal nerves
[720.0 sec] there are 12 pairs of cranial nerves and 31 pairs of spinal nerves students you know the nurse from the ears and eyes they give messages directly to the brain the messages don't go to the spinal cord types of nose
[750.0 sec] there are three types of nerves Santino's Deez Nuts from the sunset to the brain all the spinal cord they carry information
[780.0 sec] Mission about the taste smell color touch Etc Motors these no scary orders from the brain or the spinal cord to the muscles or glands mixed nuts that carry messages from the brain
[810.0 sec] to the muscles as well as send messages from the sense organs to the brain these are called mixed nerves now students let's have a lab activity that is on brain map before we start with this activity we should know what is playing Mapp
[840.0 sec] play mapping may be described as the study of specific regions of the brain and the functions they perform students you can see that the cerebrum which is the largest part of the screen has four Loops they are frontal lobe it controls our emotions
[870.0 sec] parietal law it controls of a sensation that is reacting to the environmental law it controls our vision temporal law it controls are hearing memory language Etc students
[900.0 sec] we will discuss on brain mapping during our live interaction of different types of nose
[930.0 sec] you are also aware that no scary messages in the form of impulses or electrical signals students you know how does stimulus is converted to an Impulse or electrical signal yes it is converted
[960.0 sec] Boston's organs before that we should know what is the stimulus and what is the response a situation that makes an organism react is known as a reaction
[990.0 sec] do the situation is called a response let me make you understand with a suitable example when you see somebody eating an ice cream automatically your mouth starts watering here the side of an ice cream provides a stimulus and watering of mouth is the response
[1020.0 sec] I hope you have understood what is stimulus and what is response with the help of this exam information about the environment is received by August called receptors humans have five receptors referred to as sense organs and students who are well aware of different sense organs
[1050.0 sec] start body sense organs are our windows to the outside world the way in which impulses travel through the nervous system and help us to help us respond to stimuli will be explained with the help of an example let's take the example of a cricket match
[1080.0 sec] number one receiving the stimulus is the first step in coordination suppose a filter in a cricket match sees the ball coming towards him hear what is the stimulus and the eyes are the sense organs that receive the stimulus
[1110.0 sec] the ice convert the stimulus into nerve impulses that travel to the center of a system through sensory nerves number two processing the message the brain interprets the message and accordingly prepare the response
[1140.0 sec] transferring the response the response prepared by the brain has to be transferred to the organs called effectors for example muscles or plants this is done through the motor nerves in the case of cricket match the brain sends out messages to the muscles of the hands and legs through the motor nerves instructing the
[1170.0 sec] Builder to move and catch the ball the route taken by impulses in response to a stimulus is shown on the screen you can see that sells organization
[1200.0 sec] message and prepare the response Motel carries messages to the muscles or plants I hope you have understood the mechanism of response coordination that's all about the nervous system thank you
